# Resource System Implementation

The Resource system in DoTheWorld is a robust framework designed to manage and manipulate resources such as files and directories in a **transactional** and **atomic** manner. This system ensures data integrity and consistency, making it ideal for applications that require reliable resource handling. It provides functionalities for setting and retrieving values, defining and enforcing schemas, and iterating over resources efficiently.

This document serves as an overview of the Resource system, with detailed guides available in linked sections for specific functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Transactional Operations**: Ensures that resource modifications are completed fully or not at all, preventing partial updates.
- **Atomicity**: Guarantees that operations on resources are indivisible, maintaining data consistency.
- **Schema Support**: Allows structured data management with support for primary and foreign keys.
- **Efficient Iteration**: Provides methods to traverse and process resources seamlessly.

## Detailed Guides

The following sections provide in-depth information on specific aspects of the Resource system. Each guide focuses on a particular functionality, complete with explanations, examples, and best practices.

- **[Setting Values](./resource_setting_values.md)**: Learn how to assign different types of values to resources. This guide covers the methods and best practices for updating resource data, ensuring proper data types and formats are used.
- **[Getting Values](./resource_getting_values.md)**: Understand how to retrieve data from resources. This section explains the various ways to access resource values, including handling edge cases and error scenarios.
- **[Schemas](./resource_schemas.md)**: Explore the schema system designed for structured and serializable resource management. Learn how to define schemas with primary and foreign keys to maintain data relationships and integrity.
- **[Iterable Resources](./resource_iterable.md)**: Discover how to iterate over resources using powerful methods like `each`, `map`, and others. This guide provides examples of processing large datasets efficiently and applying transformations during iteration.

## Usage Overview

The Resource system is typically used in scenarios where reliable management of files, directories, or other data entities is required. For instance, it can be employed in data processing pipelines, configuration management, or database-like operations within a file system. By leveraging the transactional and atomic nature of the system, developers can build applications that are both robust and scalable.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Resource system, refer to the linked guides above for specific tasks. Each guide includes practical examples to help you implement the functionality in your projects. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and environment setup as described in the main project documentation before proceeding with Resource operations.
